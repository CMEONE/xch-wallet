## Install

### Pre-built
We provide pre-built versions of XCH Wallet on the [Releases page](https://github.com/CMEONE/xch-wallet/releases). All of the pre-built versions are automatically generated by Github Actions using [Electron Builder Action](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/action-electron-builder).

### Build
First clone the repository. Then, navigate to the directory in your terminal and use the `npm install` command. To build the app, use `npx --no-install electron-builder`. You may be prompted by your OS for a password to sign the app for development. Please wait a few minutes for this command to run. Afterwards, you will find the app in the `/dist` folder within the directory.
